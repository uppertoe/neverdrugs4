A 12-year-old patient with Dravet syndrome required emergency anesthesia for status epilepticus. Propofol was selected as rescue therapy for induction after benzodiazepines failed. Genetic testing had confirmed an SCN1A mutation consistent with sodium channelopathy. Within minutes of induction the child developed ventricular tachycardia that rapidly progressed to cardiac arrest requiring prolonged resuscitation. The crisis was not related to respiratory depression or to inadequate ventilation. Following return of spontaneous circulation, the patient was transferred to intensive care for stabilization.
