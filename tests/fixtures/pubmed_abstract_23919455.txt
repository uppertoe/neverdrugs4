BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy 
(BMD) are associated with life-threatening perioperative complications, 
including rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and hyperthermia. Current 
recommendations contraindicate use of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetics; 
however, the latter recommendation remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To review the perioperative outcomes of patients with DMD and BMD.
METHODS: We reviewed records of patients with DMD or BMD who underwent 
anesthetic management at our institution from January 1990 through December 
2011.
RESULTS: We identified 47 patients (DMD, 37; BMD, 10) who underwent 117 
anesthetic exposures (DMD, 101; BMD, 16). Volatile anesthetic agents were used 
66 times (DMD, 59; BMD, 7). One patient with undiagnosed BMD received 
succinylcholine and developed acute rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemic cardiac 
arrest. All other major complications were attributed to the procedure (i.e., 
large bleeding), to preexisting comorbidities (i.e., respiratory failure, 
cardiac disease), or to both.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of succinylcholine in children with dystrophinopathy is 
contraindicated. These patients have significant comorbidities and are 
frequently undergoing extensive operations; complications related to these 
factors can develop, as evidenced by our series. These complications may occur 
with use of volatile and nonvolatile anesthetics. However, because most of our 
patients were older than 8 years at the time of surgery, our observation cannot 
be generalized to younger dystrophin-deficient children.
