MH is a potentially fatal disorder of skeletal muscle Ca 2+ regulation. MH episodes are triggered by exposure to certain volatile anesthetics (e.g., sevoflurane, desflurane) and depolarizing muscle relaxants (succinylcholine). MH episodes are characterized by uncontrolled muscle hypermetabolism, with a clinical presentation including hypercapnia, sinus tachycardia, masseter muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia [ 5 , 7 ]. Guidelines from the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group (EMHG) and Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) continue to inform the use of anesthetic drugs in individuals susceptible to MH [ 8 , 9 ]. In certain cases, extreme heat conditions, fever, and/or exertion can result in symptoms that mimic MH episodes (enhanced heat",

There had been ten deaths attributable to general anesthesia, specifically ethyl chloride and ether, in the proband\u2019s family. The pattern of inheritance was similar to an incomplete penetrant dominant gene or genes [ 81 ].

Although dyspedic mice die at birth owing to asphyxia resulting from skeletal muscle paralysis, this model has been successfully used to investigate components of EC coupling [ 90 ]. An MH mouse model had also been developed with the p.Arg163Cys RYR1 variant. In the homozygous state, the variant is embryonically lethal whereas the heterozygous form survives and exhibits halothane hypersensitivity [ 91 ]. However, there is no histopathology associated with this model [ 92 ], suggesting it is a valuable tool for researching MH but perhaps less so for RYR1 -RM. Alternatively, a severe homozygous zebrafish RYR1 -RM model ( relatively relaxed ) has been established which resembles RYR1 -related MmD [ 93 ]. This has proven useful for conducting high-throughput drug screening, and studies, using this model, provided rationale for the first RYR1 -RM clinical trial [ 50 ].

Although dyspedic mice die at birth owing to asphyxia resulting from skeletal muscle paralysis, this model has been successfully used to investigate components of EC coupling [ 90 ]. An MH mouse model had also been developed with the p.Arg163Cys RYR1 variant. In the homozygous state, the variant is embryonically lethal whereas the heterozygous form survives and exhibits halothane hypersensitivity [ 91 ]. However, there is no histopathology associated with this model [ 92 ], suggesting it is a valuable tool for researching MH but perhaps less so for RYR1 -RM. Alternatively, a severe homozygous zebrafish RYR1 -RM model ( relatively relaxed ) has been established which resembles RYR1 -related MmD [ 93 ]. This has proven useful for conducting high-throughput drug screening, and studies, using this model, provided rationale for the first RYR1 -RM clinical trial [ 50 ].

Findings from relevant animal models indicate that pancreatic damage in these conditions may be ameliorated through administration of the specific RyR1 antagonist dantrolene and other compounds modifying pancreatic metabolism including calcium signalling. These observations suggest that patients with RYR1 gain-of-function variants may be at increased risk of developing acute pancreatitis, a condition which should therefore be considered in the health surveillance of such individuals.\n8. snippet_id: 23\n   article_pmid: 37783627\n   article_title: Pancreatitis in RYR1-related disorders.\n   drug: neuromuscular\n   classification: risk\n   score: 2.40\n   article_rank: 5\n   source_url: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmd.2023.09.003\n   cues: malignant hyperthermia, mh\n   snippet: Despite its expression in a wide range of tissues, non-skeletal muscle manifestations associated with RYR1 mutations have only been rarely reported.
