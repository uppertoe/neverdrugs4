MH is a potentially fatal disorder of skeletal muscle Ca 2+ regulation. MH episodes are triggered by exposure to certain volatile anesthetics (e.g., sevoflurane, desflurane) and depolarizing muscle relaxants (succinylcholine). MH episodes are characterized by uncontrolled muscle hypermetabolism, with a clinical presentation including hypercapnia, sinus tachycardia, masseter muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia [ 5 , 7 ]. Guidelines from the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group (EMHG) and Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) continue to inform the use of anesthetic drugs in individuals susceptible to MH [ 8 , 9 ]. In certain cases, extreme heat conditions, fever, and/or exertion can result in symptoms that mimic MH episodes (enhanced heat",

There had been ten deaths attributable to general anesthesia, specifically ethyl chloride and ether, in the proband\u2019s family. The pattern of inheritance was similar to an incomplete penetrant dominant gene or genes [ 81 ]. Available medical records showed that the course of events in the deceased family members had been similar, with convulsion and hyperthermia noted in two cases.

Although dyspedic mice die at birth owing to asphyxia resulting from skeletal muscle paralysis, this model has been successfully used to investigate components of EC coupling [ 90 ]. An MH mouse model had also been developed with the p.Arg163Cys RYR1 variant. In the homozygous state, the variant is embryonically lethal whereas the heterozygous form survives and exhibits halothane hypersensitivity [ 91 ]. However, there is no histopathology associated with this model [ 92 ], suggesting it is a valuable tool for researching MH but perhaps less so for RYR1 -RM. Alternatively, a severe homozygous zebrafish RYR1 -RM model ( relatively relaxed ) has been established which resembles RYR1 -related MmD [ 93 ]. This has proven useful for conducting high-throughput drug screening, and studies, using this model, provided rationale for the first RYR1 -RM clinical trial [ 50 ].

Although dyspedic mice die at birth owing to asphyxia resulting from skeletal muscle paralysis, this model has been successfully used to investigate components of EC coupling [ 90 ]. An MH mouse model had also been developed with the p.Arg163Cys RYR1 variant. In the homozygous state, the variant is embryonically lethal whereas the heterozygous form survives and exhibits halothane hypersensitivity [ 91 ]. However, there is no histopathology associated with this model [ 92 ], suggesting it is a valuable tool for researching MH but perhaps less so for RYR1 -RM. Alternatively, a severe homozygous zebrafish RYR1 -RM model ( relatively relaxed ) has been established which resembles RYR1 -related MmD [ 93 ]. This has proven useful for conducting high-throughput drug screening, and studies, using this model, provided rationale for the first RYR1 -RM clinical trial [ 50 ].

However, scattered case reports and investigations of individuals with known myopathies and other muscle related problems, such as acute rhabdomyolysis or idiopathic persistently elevated creatine kinase, suggest a possible association of MH with a variety of neuromuscular diseases and stress syndromes. This association is very strong in the case of central core disease (CCD) where it is supported by clinical and laboratory evidence, including the proximity of the CCD gene to the ryanodine receptor gene on chromosome 19.\n2. claim_group_id: risk:non-depolarising-neuromuscular-blockers\n   classification: risk\n   drug_label: non-depolarising neuromuscular blockers\n   drug_classes: non-depolarising neuromuscular blocker\n   drugs: vecuronium\n   top_snippet_score: 2.30\n   supporting_snippets:\n      - snippet_id: 27\n        pmid: 11345752\n        article_title: [Anesthetic management of the King-Denborough syndrome].\n        drug: vecuronium\n        cues: avoid, mh, trigger, triggered\n        citation_url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11345752/\n        snippet_score: 2.30\n        text: He had some physical signs of KDS, e.g. pectus excavatum, low-set ears, malar hypoplasia, micrognathia, ptosis and down-slanting palpebral fissures.

Determine whether each drug is described as a trigger/risk, a safe option, a therapy/mitigation, or inconclusive.\n2. Reason about causality: do not label a drug as risk when it is merely co-administered; note when it is the therapy (e.g., dantrolene).\n3. Merge snippets that support the same conclusion into one claim and cite every snippet_id you rely on.\n4. If snippets conflict, create separate claims and explain the disagreement in the summaries/notes.\n5. Classification must be risk, safety, or uncertain. Use uncertain when evidence is mixed or insufficient.\n6. Provide short key_points (1\u20132 sentences) explaining the rationale drawn from each snippet.\n7.
