MH is a potentially fatal disorder of skeletal muscle Ca 2+ regulation. MH episodes are triggered by exposure to certain volatile anesthetics (e.g., sevoflurane, desflurane) and depolarizing muscle relaxants (succinylcholine). MH episodes are characterized by uncontrolled muscle hypermetabolism, with a clinical presentation including hypercapnia, sinus tachycardia, masseter muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia [ 5 , 7 ]. Guidelines from the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group (EMHG) and Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) continue to inform the use of anesthetic drugs in individuals susceptible to MH [ 8 , 9 ]. In certain cases, extreme heat conditions, fever, and/or exertion can result in symptoms that mimic MH episodes (enhanced heat",

Moreover, his mother and maternal grand-uncle had medical history of MH. Therefore, he was diagnosed as KDS by pediatricians. All of the preoperative examinations, including serum creatine phosphokinase level, are normal. Previous 15 case-reports suggest that in KDS patients MH might be triggered by volatile anesthetics. To avoid the trigger, we maintained the general anesthesia with propofol, fentanyl and vecuronium. During perioperative period, his body temperature was 36.3-38.1 degrees C, and no symptom of MH was observed. It is rare that a diagnosis of KDS is made preoperatively since the MH-induction is involved in the criteria of this syndrome.

Furthermore, the neurology workup diagnosed the child with King-Denborough syndrome (KDS). This particular mutation has never been documented in a patient with KDS. Atypical presentation of MH is more likely in patients with RYR1-related myopathy. A high index of suspicion for MH in children with myopathy is important. The MH hotline was helpful in the management of this patient when it was called after the initial dose of dantrolene. A neurology consult was essential for the diagnosis of KDS and future care.",

Intravenous access, an arterial line and a lumbar epidural catheter were inserted before induction of labour. Ropivacaine 0.08% + fentanyl 2 microg x mL(-1) were used for patient-controlled epidural analgesia. After 6.5 hr of labour the patient required ventilation.
